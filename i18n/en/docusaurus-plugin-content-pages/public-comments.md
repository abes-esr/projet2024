# Public Comments on Abes Project

The call for public comments is closed since October 31, 2023.  
However, you can view all the comments submitted on versions [1.1](/docs/1.1/projet2024) and [2.2](/docs/2.2/projet2024) of the project using the `hypothes.is` tool.

There are two ways to proceed.

## 1. Raw list of comments

You can follow this link, which provides the raw list of all comments submitted on the project document:  
[**All Public Comments**](https://hypothes.is/search?q=url%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fprojet2024.abes.fr%2F*)

Then you can view each comment in context by clicking the following button:

## 2. Viewing comments in context

For better usability, you can also use the browser extension provided by `hypothes.is` ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hypothesis-web-pdf-annota/bjfhmglciegochdpefhhlphglcehbmek)), which allows you to view — with contextualization — these same comments and responses from Abes, or you can use the [bookmarklet also provided by `hypothes.is`](https://web.hypothes.is/start/).

Here is a screenshot of the contextual view of comments obtained with these two other methods:
