# How to Submit Your Comments on the Abes Project?

On this page, you will find a guide for using the `hypothes.is` tool to submit public comments on Abes's 2024-2028 institutional project. The idea behind this tool is to allow annotations directly on the project text by highlighting parts of the text where you can then submit your comments.

## Step 1: Signing up for hypothesis

To be able to submit comments, prior registration on the `hypothes.is` platform is required.

- Open the **comments panel**, by <button data-hypothesis-trigger>clicking here</button> or clicking the small button found at the top right of the page:  
  <br/><img src="/img/sidebar_erm.png" alt="sidebar" width="250px" />
- Then click on [Sign up](https://hypothes.is/signup) and fill in the registration form with a username, an email address (please use your professional email address), a password, and check at least the first box to accept the terms of service:  
  <br/><img src="/img/signup.png" alt="signup form" width="300px" />
- Then check your inbox to activate your `hypothes.is` account.
- Once your account is activated, you can return to [https://projet2024.abes.fr](https://projet2024.abes.fr) in the comments panel, and log in by clicking `Log in`.

## Step 2: Submit Comments on the Project

### Open the version of the project you want to comment on

The first step to commenting is to open the version of the project you wish to comment on in your web browser. It is recommended to **comment only on the latest version of the project**. Here is the link, which you can also find on the [homepage](/), that allows you to access the latest version:  
<ConsulterProjetAbesLink />

Note that for reference purposes, the older versions of the project will remain visible and accessible via the dropdown menu at the top of the page:  
![Project versions](/img/versions-du-projet_erm.png)

### View already submitted comments

To view your comments or view public comments already submitted, open the side panel by <button data-hypothesis-trigger>clicking here</button> or by clicking the following button at the top right of the website:  
<img src="/img/sidebar_erm.png" alt="sidebar" width="250px" />

### Submit a new comment

To add a new comment, select the relevant part of the text on the page and three options will appear:  
![Toolbox](/img/toolbox.png)

- To add your comment, click on the ![Annotate](/img/annotate.png) button. You can edit your comment after posting it.
- To highlight, click the ![Highlight](/img/highlight.png) button. Note that highlighted texts will only be visible to you.

### Reply to a comment

First, open the comments side panel, then find the comment you want to reply to, and respond by clicking here:
